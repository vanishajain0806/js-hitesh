const myArr = ["Vanisha","Harhsita","Vaibhav"]
const myArr2 = ["Fruity","Chinki","Golu"]

// myArr.push(myArr2);
// console.log(myArr);// this will push the elements of myArr2 into myArr as a whole array not like element by element.//pushes in the existing array

// const newArr = myArr.concat(myArr2);
// console.log(newArr);//this returns a new array//properly both the arrays can be merged using this concat method.

// const newArr2 = [...myArr,...myArr2]//spread method...same as concat
// console.log(newArr2);//can merge more than two arrays.

// const arr = [1,2,3,[4,5],6,[7,9,8,[6,9,0]],1,2];
// const arr2 = arr.flat(Infinity)//it will flat all the indepth arrays...Infinity shows the no of depth, you can specify any number as well
// console.log(arr2);//means it will remove the depths and concatenate all the elements as a 1D array.

// console.log(Array.isArray("vanisha"));//returns false//it is asking whether "vanisha" is an array
// console.log(Array.from("Vanisha"));//converts it in Array.
// console.log(Array.from({name:"Vanisha"})); //intersting//returns an empty array because it was not possible for it to convert into array.

// let score1 = 100
// let score2 = 200
// let score3 = 300
// console.log(Array.of(score1,score2,score3));//returns a new array from the set of elements.
